# Searching_algorithms_with_java
<I>this contains basic sorting algorithms in java</I>

1.Linear Search Algorithm
<p>this is suitable for small data set. but the data set getting larger this will not be a better one.</p>

2.Binary search Algorithm
<p>This takes more time for small data sets but when the data set large this is more efficient than the <B>Linear Search Algorithm</b></p>
